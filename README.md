# Netflix-Movies-and-Tv-Shows-Clustering

Summary and Conclusion:

This project has delved into a comprehensive dataset sourced from Flixable, offering a detailed snapshot of Netflix's content library up until 2019. Through rigorous data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and text preprocessing, we've unearthed fascinating patterns and trends within Netflix's extensive content offerings.

Notably, the analysis revealed a remarkable surge in TV show offerings since 2010, contrasting with a substantial drop in movie titles during the same period. This dichotomy underscores the evolving landscape of content consumption on the platform and presents intriguing avenues for further exploration.

Utilizing advanced clustering techniques and a robust recommender system, we've revolutionized the user experience by offering tailored recommendations based on individual preferences. By categorizing shows into clusters and providing relevant suggestions, we aim to enhance user engagement and satisfaction on the platform.

Overall, this project provides valuable insights into the dynamic evolution of content on Netflix and highlights the importance of leveraging data-driven techniques to optimize content curation and improve user experiences in the digital age.
